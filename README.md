# ML-Project-Predictive-Modeling-and-Analysis
Final project for the Machine Learning course (A.Y. 2024/25, University of Pavia). The notebook explores the relationship between music preferences and mental health, building ML models to classify anxiety as significant or not significant.

# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Project â€“ Music & Mental Health

Final project for the Machine Learning course (A.Y. 2024/25, University of Pavia).  
The goal is to classify **anxiety levels** (significant / not significant) using the **MxMH Survey dataset** from Kaggle, which combines music preferences, listening habits, and self-reported mental health conditions.  

The notebook covers:
- Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis  
- Training of classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix  

ðŸ“Š Results highlight correlations between music habits and mental health, with models achieving promising performance in anxiety classification.
