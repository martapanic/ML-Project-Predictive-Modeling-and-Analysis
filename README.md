# ML-Project-Predictive-Modeling-and-Analysis
Final project for the Machine Learning course (A.Y. 2024/25, University of Pavia). The notebook explores the relationship between music preferences and mental health, building ML models to classify anxiety as significant or not significant.

# 🧠🎶 Machine Learning Project – Music & Mental Health  

📚 Final project for the Machine Learning course *(A.Y. 2024/25, University of Pavia)*.  
The goal is to classify **anxiety levels** (😟 significant / 🙂 not significant) using the **MxMH Survey dataset** from Kaggle, which combines 🎵 music preferences, 🎧 listening habits, and 🧑‍⚕️ self-reported mental health conditions.
